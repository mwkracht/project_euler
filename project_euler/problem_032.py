We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly
once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier,
and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a
1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in
your sum.

    A two digit number multiplied by a 3 digit number can product a 4 digit number while a three
        digit number multiplied by a 3 digit number cannot.

    Based on these two statements and since multiplication is commutative, a can be up to a 2 digit
    number and b can be up to a four digit number.

    Iterate through the possible products and search factors to find pandigital pairs.

    10,000 can be used a max product for the search because it is a 5 digit number and the max
    2 digit time 2 digit number is 99 * 99 = 9801 which is less than 10000 and the max one digit
    number times 3 digit number is 9 * 999 = 8991 which is also less than 10000.

    Overall this should be faster than other brute force solution. Both solutions have to iterate
    1 to 9999 in one loop but in this solution the second loop on average iterates up to 67 while
